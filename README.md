3. **Manage Scrolling**: Implement smart timing for scrolling through content
4. **Detect Sponsored Content**: Identify and optionally skip advertisements
5. **Track Statistics**: Record usage data for each platform
6. **Enforce Limits**: Stop automatic scrolling when your daily limit is reached

- **Coroutines**: Asynchronous operations for smooth user experience
- **MVVM Architecture**: Clean separation of UI and business logic
